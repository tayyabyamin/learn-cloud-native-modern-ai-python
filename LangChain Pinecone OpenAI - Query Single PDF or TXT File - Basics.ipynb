And the Scarecrow\\nfound a tree full of nuts and filled Dorothy’s basket with them, so\\nthat she would not be hungry for a long time. She thought this was very\\nkind and thoughtful of the Scarecrow, but she laughed heartily at the\\nawkward way in which the poor creature picked up the nuts. His padded\\nhands were so clumsy and the nuts were so small that he dropped almost\\nas many as he put in the basket. But the Scarecrow did not mind how\\nlong it took him to fill the basket, for it enabled him to keep away\\nfrom the fire, as he feared a spark might get into his straw and burn\\nhim up. So he kept a good distance away from the flames, and only came\\nnear to cover Dorothy with dry leaves when she lay down to sleep. These\\nkept her very snug and warm, and she slept soundly until morning.\\n\\nWhen it was daylight, the girl bathed her face in a little rippling\\nbrook, and soon after they all started toward the Emerald City.\\n\\nThis was to be an eventful day for the travelers. They had hardly been\\nwalking an hour when they saw before them a great ditch that crossed\\nthe road and divided the forest as far as they could see on either\\nside. It was a very wide ditch, and when they crept up to the edge and\\nlooked into it they could see it was also very deep, and there were\\nmany big, jagged rocks at the bottom. The sides were so steep that none\\nof them could climb down, and for a moment it seemed that their journey\\nmust end.\\n\\n“What shall we do?” asked Dorothy despairingly.\\n\\n“I haven’t the faintest idea,” said the Tin Woodman, and the Lion shook\\nhis shaggy mane and looked thoughtful.\\n\\nBut the Scarecrow said, “We cannot fly, that is certain. Neither can we\\nclimb down into this great ditch. Therefore, if we cannot jump over it,\\nwe must stop where we are.”\\n\\n“I think I could jump over it,” said the Cowardly Lion, after measuring\\nthe distance carefully in his mind.' metadata={}\n"

These tools directly \\nimpact operational eﬃciency, \\nwhich has downstream impacts on \\nthe overall customer experience, \\nwith reliable delivery and fewer \\ndelays.\\nFor inventory management and \\ndemand forecasting, logistics \\nand supply chain companies are \\nadopting AI to help reduce costs, \\nimprove customer satisfaction, \\nand improve forecast accuracy.TOP USE CASES BY INDUSTRYLogistics and Supply Chain\\nFor route planning, logistics and \\nsupply chain companies believe AI \\ncan help improve eﬃciency, reduce \\ncosts, improve delivery accuracy, \\nand reduce shipping times. This \\ndirectly translates to improved \\noperational eﬃciency and a better \\ncustomer experience while indirect -\\nly translating to revenue growth.\\nFor document processing, logistics \\nand supply chain companies look \\nto AI to help them with informa -\\ntion processing, document clas -\\nsiﬁcation, and compliance. This \\napplication is strictly dedicated to \\nincreasing operational eﬃciency \\nand reducing costs.\\nLogistics and supply chain com -\\npanies process a lot of paperwork. \\nTo improve operational eﬃciency, \\nthis paperwork must be pro -\\ncessed as quickly and accurately \\nas possible. Logistics documents, \\nsuch as bills of lading, commercial \\ninvoices, and packing lists are full \\nof critical information required to \\nclear shipments past customs and \\nonto warehouses for distribution. \\nTraditional OCR applications re -\\nquire the creation of templates for \\neach type of document, which is \\ninfeasible and ineﬃcient for global \\nlogistics companies. Instead, these \\ncompanies rely on machine-learn -\\ning-powered document process -\\ning, which requires no templates \\nand still processes the documents \\nat over over 95% accuracy.TOP USE CASES BY INDUSTRY', metadata={'source': '../data/Scale-Zeitgeist-AI-Readiness-Report-2023.pdf', 'page': 15})"
